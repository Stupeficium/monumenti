Find all the monuments that adhere to Wiki Loves Monuments Italy and upload your photos. From September 1 to 30 participate in the photo Guinness World Records winning contest.
With the app Wiki Loves Monuments Italia you can see directly from your phone which monuments can be photographed for the Wiki Loves Monuments contest. Look for them on the interactive map or by consulting a list. Take a photo and upload it through the application, to make it available on Wikimedia Commons. Or wait until September 1 and upload the photos you keep in your gallery: this way you will automatically participate in the largest photo contest in the world.
The Wiki Loves Monuments Italia app makes use of location and map features and is connected to OpenStreetMap and Wikidata to provide you with all available information about the monuments, such as name, description and address. It allows you to conveniently upload as many photos as you want to Wikimedia Commons, even while you're away from home. You can search for a specific city to see its photographable monuments, or search for them based on your location.
